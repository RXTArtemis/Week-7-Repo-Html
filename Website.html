<p> To experience different cultures, the best place to start is with food. What better option than to start with dessert? Especially ice cream. This is a picture of what a store front of an ice cream shop looks like.</p>

<p> As you can see, ice cream is no joke in Argentina. This cone is called a Cuccurucho.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is that in Argentina, the option exists to buy cones, dishes or even a whopping 2 pounds of ice cream. In this case, I chose the classic Dulce de Leche ice cream with Ferrero Rocher ice cream.</p>
